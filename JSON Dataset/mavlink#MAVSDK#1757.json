To my understanding, you need to set the velocity setpoint to something and MAVSDK runs a thread to send the setpoints at the correct frequency required by PX4. I do that and whenever I try to switch to offboard mode, I get Switching to Offboard is Currently not available. Sometimes it does work but it seems to be luck when it does.\r\n\r\nIs there something I am doing wrong?\r\n\r\nMAVSDK v0.50.1\r\nPX4 1.12.3", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mavlink/MAVSDK/issues/1757/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/mavlink/MAVSDK/issues/1757/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
