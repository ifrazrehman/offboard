I am assuming that `vehicle_rates_setpoint_s` corresponds to Euler angle rates in [L1614 at `mavlink_receiver.cpp`](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/blob/77a37c26bf7696d6ce8658a94339e3e28de340c4/src/modules/mavlink/mavlink_receiver.cpp#L1614). It is possible to handle the conversion from target angular velocity to target angle-rates on the sender side, but I was curious if there is interest to support this in PX4.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Maybe Bug?\r\nNot sure if this is related to `OFFBOARD`, but, it is also unclear to me why `vehicle_rates_setpoint` is used to update [`_angular_velocity_sp` in L178 at AngularVelocityController.cpp](https://github.com/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/blob/6135bb384b5189deef0dd48245b31881ae26915a/src/modules/angular_velocity_controller/AngularVelocityController.cpp#L178). Is this simply an overload?\r\n\r\n\r\nThanks in advance.", "closed_by": null, "reactions": {"url": "https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/19486/reactions", "total_count": 0, "+1": 0, "-1": 0, "laugh": 0, "hooray": 0, "confused": 0, "heart": 0, "rocket": 0, "eyes": 0}, "timeline_url": "https://api.github.com/repos/PX4/PX4-Autopilot/issues/19486/timeline", "performed_via_github_app": null, "state_reason": null}
